# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Alert is a project designed to extend Uptime Kuma's capabilities, starting with
MQTT server monitoring functionality. The system will work alongside Uptime Kuma
to provide enhanced monitoring capabilities for MQTT servers by maintaining an
MQTT client that records connection status and latency metrics. This initial
implementation focuses on the core MQTT monitoring functionality, with the
architecture designed to support future extensions to other Uptime Kuma
features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor the status of MQTT
servers through Uptime Kuma, so that I can ensure my MQTT infrastructure is
functioning properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Uptime Kuma sends a GET request to the Alert system THEN the system
   SHALL respond with the current MQTT server status.
2. WHEN the Alert system starts THEN it SHALL establish a connection to the
   configured MQTT server.
3. WHEN the Alert system is running THEN it SHALL continuously monitor and
   record the MQTT server connection status.
4. WHEN the Alert system is running THEN it SHALL measure and record the
   connection latency to the MQTT server.
5. IF the MQTT server connection is lost THEN the system SHALL record the
   disconnection event.
6. IF the MQTT server connection is restored THEN the system SHALL record the
   reconnection event.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Alert system to have a clean and
extensible architecture, so that additional Uptime Kuma feature extensions can
be added in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the system THEN the codebase SHALL follow a modular design
   that separates MQTT functionality from core system components.
2. WHEN designing data structures THEN the system SHALL use minimal, focused
   data structures that fulfill the current requirements without unnecessary
   complexity.
3. WHEN implementing the API THEN the system SHALL provide clear endpoints that
   can be extended for future Uptime Kuma feature integrations.
